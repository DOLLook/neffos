- Adaptive request upgradation and server dialing
- Acknowledgements
- Namespaces
- Rooms
- Broadcast
- Event-Driven architecture
- Request-Response architecture
- Error Awareness
- Asynchronous Broadcast
- Timeouts
- Encoding
- Reconnection
- Modern neffos API client for Browsers, Nodejs[*](https://github.com/kataras/neffos.js) and Go
